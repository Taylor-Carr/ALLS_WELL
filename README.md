### Project Initial ERD and data base design

## Develop strategy and Wireframe

## Miro Board
The Miro Board was the initial tool we used for iteration. The board allowed us to quicky communicate how the over project will be worked on, start until finished, placed all articles and pictures we will be using and the technology that will be used.  

## Balsamiq
Balsamiq was used to design the initial idea of the All Well’s website which entailed all user features, navigation and placeholders for pictures that would be incorporated within the website. Theres not much difference between our initial thought and the final product we had produced.

## Lucid Chart

We decided to create a visual map of the website so we could clearly conceptualise the project as a whole.

## Github project

For our User Stories, we had decided to use Github project. We had some userstories remaining, which which will be great add-ons for the next iteration.

## Setting up the Django project

## Defining models

## Implementing views and templates

## Handling authorization and Authentication

## Integrating forms and business logic

## Styling frontend development

## Fixed Bugs

Summernote stops the display of Event/Article type in Article Admin Screen.

![Old Code](/assets/images/readme/old_code.png)

The code higlighted in the article model above displayed the Event/Article content type on the admin page. This was broken by Summernote.
This functionality is being left in place in case it works somewhere other than the admin panel!

![New Code](/assets/images/readme/new_code.png)

Adding the highlighted code to the Summernote admin class replaced the lost funtionality resulting in the image below.
